# SIBR Core

When I wanted to install the [gaussian splatting repo](https://github.com/sensyn-robotics/gaussian-splatting) (well one that installs on modern machines), and build this viewer I got all sorts of problems. This is claude fixing them :).

Tested on ubuntu 24.04, CUDA SDK 12.9, 5070ti. 

See [SIBR Documentation](https://sibr.gitlabpages.inria.fr) for more details and readme.
Details on how to run in the documentation and in the section below.
